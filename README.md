<h1>Failed RDP to IP Geolocation Information</h1>


 ### [YouTube Demonstration (@16:20)](https://youtu.be/RoZeVbbZ0o0?t=980)


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>In this lab we will created a Map in Azure Sentinel that will display multiple brute force attacks from all over the world.  We will use a Virtual Machine to crete a Honeypot where the malicious attackers can try to gain access to for the logging we need to plot those attacks on our Map in Azure Sentinel
</b>
<br />
<br />
The script is used in this demo where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot.
We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to
look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
