<h1>Failed RDP to IP Geolocation Information</h1>


 ### [YouTube Demonstration (@16:20)](https://youtu.be/RoZeVbbZ0o0?t=980)


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>In this lab we will created a Map in Azure Sentinel that will display multiple brute force attacks from all over the world.  We will use a Virtual Machine to crete a Honeypot where the malicious attackers can try to gain access to for the logging we need to plot those attacks on our Map in Azure Sentinel

Let us now set the Newtork Security Groups of this Virtual Machine TERRIBLY!!

Now that we have set the TERRIBLE Network Security Groups, we will Review nad Crete our HoneyPot

While we wait for our Virtual Machine to deploy, lets get started on creating our Log Analystics Workspace Resource

With our Virtual Machine and Log Analytics Workspace now created, lets set up our Microsoft Defneder Setting to give up some alerts and to use a couple of their servers for our logs.
